Abstract
Goal creation in ice hockey is complicated and difficult to understand. 

Unlike baseball, players and puck are always moving and a combination of 5 players produces a goal.

A team is always looking for a player who can contribute to team goals. 

National Hockey League has about 7000 goals per season. This study analyzes goals and assists in NHL to predict the contribution of each player to team goals in the following season with weighted multiple linear regression. 

I scraped NHL game documents from NHL official website to explore which factors are most highly associated with a teamâ€™s goals next season. I divide the data into different manpower situations and different positions. 

Usually, the most important variables to predict the number of goals in the following seasons are the team goals (goals with assists).
